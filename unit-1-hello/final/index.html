<!--For this project, I wanted to make a webpage about my favorite movie genre! I was hoping to make something more visually interesting than just a top-down list of movies, so I learned to format it in a table from W3 Schools. I'm only missing some CSS elements (color for the website, for one thing, and maybe a background pattern) and a few more images to make the website really pop!-->

    <h1>Celia's Movie Shark-ive</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my Shark Ark! Below is a list of some terrible shark movies that I've watched and want to withstand the test of time. Most of these films were released within a few years of each other, typically around the 2017-18 range, and none of them ever had the dignity of being shown in any self-respecting movie theater. By no means is this list all-inclusive—it's meant to showcase my all-time favorites, for better or for worse. You will not find quality or mainstream movies on this list.</p>

                <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8387464/'>House Shark (2017):</a>
            </dt>
                <dd>Nearly two hours of derivative humor and <em>Airplane</em>-esque jokes that make for a perfect watch with friends! There's no CGI to be found here: only the most terrible practical effects that never let you forget you're watching a low-budget passion project with a handful of actors. This is my highest recommendation!</dd>
            <dt>
                <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8305692/'>Santa Jaws (2018):</a>
            </dt>
                <dd>Delightfully bad movie with subpar acting and some of the most unlikeable characters in any creature feature! The premise is interesting, and the shark's powers are surprisingly consistent throughout the film, which I appreciate! I'm an avid holiday movie hater, but this one really speaks to my soul.</dd>
            <dt>
                <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6973866/'>Toxic Shark (2017):</a>
            </dt>
                <dd>A somewhat appealing plot that boasts some comically awful CGI and more terrible people to root against. As is the case with all of these straight-to-TV flicks, go into this experience expecting absolutely nothing good, and you'll be rewarded with pure comedy.</dd>
            <dt>
                <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8856940/'>Nightmare Shark (2018):</a>
            </dt>
                <dd>The strongest feature of this movie is the shark itself: since it's an imaginary (but still very dangerous) enemy, and you get to embrace the absurdity of the fight scenes and the kills! The premise, characters, and execution are decent, which makes it more of a B+movie than a B-movie.</dd>

                <a href='https://www.imdb.com/list/ls083061472/'>X-Headed Shark Attack Series (2012-18):</a>
            </dt>
                <dd>Despite 2-Headed Shark Attack being the first movie, I honestly recommend leaving that one as background noise. Its sexualization of the women in the movie stretches into truly obnoxious territory, and the CGI, gore, and plot are not gripping enough to make it a worthwhile watch in my book. The sequels, however, lean into the comedic factor with increasing heads equating to increasing absurdity: 2-Headed Shark Attack (2012), 3-Headed Shark Attack (2015), 5-Headed Shark Attack (2017), 6-Headed Shark Attack (2018). "What happened to 4-Headed Shark Attack?" you wonder to yourself—that's not my place to say here, since it's teetering into spoiler territory, so you'll just have to watch to find out yourself!</dd>

                <a href='https://www.imdb.com/list/ls022880726/'>Sharktopus Series (2010-15):</a>
            </dt>
                <dd>This series represents the pinnacle of CGI in shark movies. Some of the scenes don't blend too well with real people, but the titular Sharktopus is a fully-rendered creature that looks shockingly reasonable with the fluidity of its movements. The sequels showcase similar skill, but of course, it's coupled with terrible acting, accents, and characters to keep the movies firmly near the bottom of the barrel. This series includes Sharktopus (2010), Sharktopus vs. Pteracuda (2014), and Sharktopus vs. Whalewolf (2015). The last of these is my favorite for all the wrong reasons, with the plot and characters being firmly in the background compared to the monsters fighting, except for the shark-movie-typical oversexualization of the female scientist, of course.</dd>

                <a href='https://www.imdb.com/list/ls020776076/'>Sharknado Series (2013-18):</a>
            </dt>
                <dd>This series is the blueprint for terrible shark movies, and for good reason! Ian Ziering is the perfect lead for this movie (who also participated in Worst Cooks in America, might I add) with his gritty line deliveries and immense commitment to the bit! The sequels, especially the fourth, fifth, and sixth movies, are incredibly creative and embrace the ridiculousness, and their titles show just that: Sharknado (2013), Sharknado 2: The Second One (2014), Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! (2015), Sharknado 4: The 4th Awakens (2016), Sharknado 5: Global Swarming (2017), The Last Sharknado: It's About Time (2018). The Sharknadoes transcend time and space, and the series makes for a surprisingly gripping narrative with its recurring characters and high stakes.</dd>
