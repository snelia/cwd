<!-- For this project, I wanted to make a webpage about my favorite movie genre! I was hoping to make something more visually interesting than just a top-down list of movies, so I learned to format it in a table from W3 Schools. One thing that I noticed about many GeoCities websites in archives is that they feature dozens of GIFs that they liked, even when they added nothing to the site, so I wanted to do the same! Hence the shark tank column in my table. -->

    <p>Welcome to my Shark Ark! Below is a list of some terrible shark movies that I've watched and want to withstand the test of time. Most of these films were released within a few years of each other, typically around the 2017-18 range, and none of them ever had the dignity of being shown in any self-respecting movie theater. By no means is this list all-inclusive—it's meant to showcase my all-time favorites, for better or for worse. You will not find quality or mainstream movies on this list.</p>

                <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8387464/'>House Shark (2017):</a>
            </dt>
                <dd>Nearly two hours of derivative humor and <em>Airplane</em>-esque jokes that make for a perfect watch with friends! There's no CGI to be found here: only clumsy practical effects that never let you forget you're watching a low-budget passion project.</dd>
            <dt>
                <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8305692/'>Santa Jaws (2018):</a>
            </dt>
                <dd>Delightfully bad movie with subpar acting and annoying characters! The villain is a magical shark that can only be hurt with Christmas gear: I'm a holiday movie hater, but this one speaks to my soul.</dd>
            <dt>
                <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6973866/'>Toxic Shark (2017):</a>
            </dt>
                <dd>An acid-spewing shark movie with comically awful CGI and more terrible people to root against. Go into this experience expecting nothing good, and you'll be rewarded with pure comedy.</dd>
            <dt>
                <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8856940/'>Nightmare Shark (2018):</a>
            </dt>
                <dd>The strongest feature of this movie is the shark itself: since it's an imaginary (but still very dangerous) enemy, and you get to embrace the absurdity of the fight scenes and the kills! It's more of a B+movie than a B-movie!</dd>
            <dt>
                <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6982720/'>Trailer Park Shark (2017):</a>
            </dt>
                <dd>The acting and creativity are honestly remarkable, even if the shark itself looks bad. I almost found myself rooting for our country bumpkins because the non-shark villain was so annoying.</dd>
            <dt>
                <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6846128/'>Empire of the Sharks (2017):</a>
            </dt>
                <dd>Most of the world is underwater, which makes for an interesting premise. However, three people mind-control sharks in this movie (which feels like at least two too many), and you could easily predict the entire plot after the first five minutes.</dd>
            <dt>
                <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6581990/'>Mississippi River Sharks (2017):</a>
            </dt>
                <dd>Tourists get mauled and the corrupt local government covers it up in <em>Jaws</em> fashion to make for a standard shark movie plot with some goofy kills. It's the least outlandish premise, but no higher in quality.</dd>
            <dt>
                <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8805150/'>Surrounded (2018):</a>
            </dt>
                <dd>This is the kind of movie that makes you reevaluate your life choices: annoying vloggers end up stranded and picked off one by one. Laugh at this movie, not with it—if these people can be actors, anyone can.</dd>

                <a href='https://www.imdb.com/list/ls083061472/'>X-Headed Shark Attack Series (2012-18):</a>
            </dt>
                <dd>Despite 2-Headed Shark Attack being the first movie, I honestly recommend leaving that one as background noise. Its sexualization of the women in the movie stretches into truly obnoxious territory, and the CGI, gore, and plot are not gripping enough to make it a worthwhile watch in my book. The sequels, however, lean into the comedic factor with increasing heads equating to increasing absurdity: 2-Headed Shark Attack (2012), 3-Headed Shark Attack (2015), 5-Headed Shark Attack (2017), 6-Headed Shark Attack (2018). "What happened to 4-Headed Shark Attack?" you wonder to yourself—that's not my place to say here, since it's teetering into spoiler territory, so you'll just have to watch to find out yourself!</dd>
            <dt>
                <a href='https://www.imdb.com/list/ls022880726/'>Sharktopus Series (2010-15):</a>
            </dt>
                <dd>This series represents the pinnacle of CGI in shark movies. Some of the scenes don't blend too well with real people, but the titular Sharktopus is a fully-rendered creature that looks shockingly reasonable with the fluidity of its movements. The sequels showcase similar skill, but of course, it's coupled with terrible acting, accents, and characters to keep the movies firmly near the bottom of the barrel. This series includes Sharktopus (2010), Sharktopus vs. Pteracuda (2014), and Sharktopus vs. Whalewolf (2015). The last of these is my favorite for all the wrong reasons, with the plot and characters being firmly in the background compared to the monsters fighting, except for the shark-movie-typical oversexualization of the female scientist, of course.</dd>
            <dt>
                <a href='https://www.imdb.com/list/ls020776076/'>Sharknado Series (2013-18):</a>
            </dt>
                <dd>This series is the blueprint for terrible shark movies, and for good reason! Ian Ziering is the perfect lead for this movie (who also participated in Worst Cooks in America, might I add) with his gritty line deliveries and immense commitment to the bit! The sequels, especially the fourth, fifth, and sixth movies, are incredibly creative and embrace the ridiculousness, and their titles show just that: Sharknado (2013), Sharknado 2: The Second One (2014), Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! (2015), Sharknado 4: The 4th Awakens (2016), Sharknado 5: Global Swarming (2017), The Last Sharknado: It's About Time (2018). The Sharknadoes transcend time and space, and the series makes for a surprisingly gripping narrative with its recurring characters and high stakes.</dd>

    <p>Curious about my favorites? House Shark and Sharknado 2: The Second One take the cake for me! Where House Shark is so bad it's good, Sharknado 2 is so good it's good. They're the kinds of movies that are beyond funny to watch with friends, and once they're done, you realize they might actually be cinema at its finest. Here's a tip: it's almost impossible to stay quiet during these movies because increasingly insane things keep happening, so keep your subtitles on.</p>
