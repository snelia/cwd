<h1>A Conversation</h1>

<!--I'm terrible at naming things, so I just used the top row of the keyboard for the class names.-->

<p class="qwert">We need to talk.</p>

<p class="poiuy">Why? What's wrong?</p>

<p class="qwert">Nothing's wrong. I just wanted to ask you something.</p>

<p class="poiuy">...Alright. Go ahead, then.</p>

<p class="qwert">Valentine's Day is coming up.</p>

<p class="poiuy">Right.</p>

<p class="qwert">I was thinking about us, and something occurred to me.</p>

<p class="qwert">I realized that something needs to change.</p>

<p class="poiuy">You're stressing me out!</p>

<p class="qwert">Okay, I'll just get to the point, then.</p>

<p class="poiuy">I feel like I know where this is going...</p>

<p class="qwert">It's not your fault at all—it's mine.</p>

<p class="poiuy">I can't believe you're doing this so close to Valentine's Day!</p>

<p class="qwert">I know. I can't either.</p>

<p class="qwert">But we might have to move our reservation to be an hour later.</p>

<p class="poiuy"><em>...WHAT?!</em></p>

<p class="qwert">My sister asked me to pick up Emily from soccer practice.</p>

<p class="qwert">I'll call the restaurant to let them know after work today.</p>

<p class="poiuy">...We need to talk about the way 'We need to talk' sounds to most people.</p>
